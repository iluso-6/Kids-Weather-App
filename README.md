***Android Weather Application intended to be used by children aged 5+ years on small dimentional (Nexus 5 xxdpi) mobile phones and in the vertical orientation.
I have employed location and background services here as a means of fully understanding their functionality.
This application uses the services of Open Weather Map Api.***
